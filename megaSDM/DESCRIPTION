Description: This package can efficiently create and project species distribution models using the 
             MaxEnt algorithm and parallel processing. It can find and download occurrence data 
             for a list of species on GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), environmentally
             subsample the occurrences to mitigate spatial bias, generate background (pseudo-absence)
             points, train the model and project it to different times (incorporating dispersal rate
             of each species and intermediate range fluctuations), and create species richness maps for
             each time period and taxon.
