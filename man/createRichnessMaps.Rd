\title{Create regular and dispersal-constrained richness maps from stacked SDMs}
\usage{
createRichnessMaps(
  result_dir,
  time_periods,
  scenarios = NA,
  dispersal = FALSE,
  taxonlist = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result_dir}{the directory where the ensembled and binary maps are placed.
Each species should have its own sub-directory, and the forecasted/hindcasted
binary maps should be placed into directories like so: Species/Scenario/Time.
If \code{projectSuit} was used to make these maps, this is probably the same
as the \code{output} argument in that function.}

\item{time_periods}{a vector of the years in which the projection will occur with the first element
as the original year (the year in which the model was generated). If no precise years
are available for future/past time periods (e.g., using data from the Last Glacial Maximum),
order the remaining time periods from most current to least current (farthest into the future/past)
and give character strings for the years (e.g., "LGM").}

\item{scenarios}{a vector of character strings detailing the different climate models
used in the forecasted/hindcasted species distribution models. If no projection is
needed, set to NA (default).}

\item{dispersal}{(logical \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) Are dispersal rate analyses
needed? If set to \code{TRUE}, this function constructs dispersal-constrained richness
maps for all time periods/scenarios given, and compares those maps to the non-dispersal
constrained maps. If these analysis are not needed, or if the \code{megaSDM::dispersalRate}
function has yet to be run, this should be set to \code{FALSE} (default).}

\item{taxonlist}{(optional) data.frame or .csv file path name.
If taxon-specific species richness maps are required, this should correspond to
a list of all species modelled (Column 1) and a selected higher taxon
(Column 2; e.g., Order, Class) to split the richness maps on. If taxon-specific
richness maps are not required, \code{taxonlist} should be set to \code{FALSE} (default).}
}
\value{
writes .pdf files and rasters (.grd) of species richness for all given
taxa, time periods, and scenarios and dispersal constraints to the directory
"\code{result_dir}/RichnessMaps".
}
\description{
This function stacks binary (presence/absence) species distribution maps to
create richness maps for a list of species. If higher taxa are provided
(i.e., mammals), separate richness maps for each higher taxon will be created
in addition to the full species richness maps. Given hindcasted/forecasted
binary maps, future/past species richness will also be calculated. Rasters
and .pdf files of each are generated, and the legend is standardized across
all .pdf maps for effective comparisons. Finally, provided distribution maps
that are constrained by dispersal rate, this function compares between the
dispersal-constrained and regular richness maps.
