\usage{
BackgroundPoints(
  spplist,
  envdata,
  output,
  nbg = 5000,
  spatial_weights = 0,
  buffers,
  method = "Varela",
  PCA = "Y",
  ncores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spplist}{a vector of species names (used for the generation of output file names).}

\item{envdata}{a SpatRaster or list of raster files corresponding to the
area the model will be trained on. If environmental subsampling is desired (method = \code{"Varela"}),
all environmental layers used for the modelling should be included.}

\item{output}{a file folder where the output background point files will be placed.}

\item{nbg}{either a single integer or a vector of the same length as \code{spplist},
corresponding to the number of background points generated for each set of background points.
Should be in the same order as the species list.}

\item{spatial_weights}{a number between 0 and 1 determining the percentage of background points
sampled within the given buffer. A 1 indicates that background points are exclusively sampled
from within the buffers, whereas a 0 indicates random sampling throughout the training area.}

\item{buffers}{(optional) a list of shapefiles (SpatVec) or a list of file paths
for the buffers. Required if \code{spatial_weights} is not 0. Should be in the same order
as the species list. If only one species is needed, can be a single SpatialPolygon* object.}

\item{method}{either "Varela" or "random", where "Varela" incorporates environmental subsampling
(see Varela et al. 2014) and "random" simply randomly samples background points.
Note that if method = "Varela", exact numbers of background points cannot be guaranteed.}

\item{PCA}{(optional). The number of PC axes to use when binning climate data for environmental
subsampling. Can be a number from 1 to the number of environmental variables. Default selects the
number of axes that account for 95\% of the environmental variation. If set to \code{NA},
PCA will not be run (for use when there are categorical variables, for instance).}

\item{ncores}{the number of computer cores to parallelize the background point generation on. Default is 1.
Using one fewer core than the computer has is usually optimal.}
}
\value{
writes .csv files of background points for each species in \code{spplist} to a
directory provided by the \code{output} argument. These files have the coordinates of the points and the
environmental values at each point. In addition, if \code{method = "Varela"}, a .csv file is written
out with the number of background points generated for each species, as the exact number of
points may vary.
}
\description{
This function generates a set of species-specific background points using a variety
of methods. These points can be generally across a given training area, or if
environmental data are provided, environmental subsampling (sensu Varela et al. 2014)
can be conducted. If a list of buffers around the occurrence points of each species
are provided, \code{BackgroundPoints} can conduct spatially-constrained sampling
within the buffer (\code{spatial_weights} = 1) or a hybrid method (\code{spatial_weights} between 0 and 1).
