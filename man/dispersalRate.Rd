\title{Constrain Modelled Species Distributions by Dispersal Ability}
\usage{
dispersalRate(result_dir, dispersaldata, time_periods, scenarios, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{result_dir}{the directory where the ensembled and binary maps are placed.
Each species should have its own sub-directory, and the forecasted/hindcasted
binary maps should be placed into directories like so: Species/Scenario/Time.
If \code{projectSuit} was used to make these maps, this is probably the same
as the \code{output} argument in that function.}

\item{dispersaldata}{either a dataframe or the complete path name of a
.csv file with two columns:

Column 1: species name (same as the name used for modelling).

Column 2: average dispersal rate of species in kilometers/year.}

\item{time_periods}{a vector of the years in which the projection will occur. The first
element should be the original year (the year in which the model was generated).}

\item{scenarios}{a vector of character strings detailing the different climate models
used in the forecasted/hindcasted species distribution models.}

\item{ncores}{the number of computer cores to parallelize the background point generation on.
Default is 1; Using one fewer core than the computer has is usually optimal.}
}
\value{
returns rasters and .pdf files of the projected species ranges for future time
periods, given different climate scenarios, when the ability of the species to disperse
is taken into account. Dispersal-constrained presence/absence maps and "invadable suitability"
maps are provided as outputs.
}
\description{
This function incorporates the ability of a species to disperse over time into
projected habitat suitability models and presence/absence maps. The probability
of dispersal per year as a function of distance is modelled using an exponential
distribution, and summed together to create a probability of dispersal for the
intervals between each provided time step. Dispersal-constrained binary (presence
and absence) maps are generated, as well as continuous maps of "invadable suitability"
(see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.05450).
}
\details{
NOTE: dispersal rate analyses are only informative for predicting species
distributions into the future (forecasting) rather than predicting past
distributions (hindcasting), as range contractions and extirpations are not
limited by dispersal rate.
