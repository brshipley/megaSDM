\usage{
MaxEntModel(
  occlist,
  bglist,
  model_output,
  ncores = 1,
  nrep = 1,
  categorical = NA,
  alloutputs = TRUE,
  reptype = "Subsample",
  test_percent = 20,
  features = c("linear", "quadratic", "product", "threshold", "hinge"),
  testsamples = FALSE,
  regularization = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occlist}{a list of .csv file names, each containing the occurrence
points of a given taxon. The files should be named the same as the taxon
of interest (e.g.,: ".../Canis_lupus.csv").}

\item{bglist}{a list of .csv files corresponding to the background points
provided for each taxon. This list of files should be ordered in the same
way as the files given by \code{occlist}.}

\item{model_output}{the directory where all output files will be placed.}

\item{ncores}{the number of computer cores to parallelize the background point generation on.
Default is 1; Using one fewer core than the computer has is usually optimal.}

\item{nrep}{(integer) the number of replicates to run each species through.}

\item{categorical}{(character). If categorical variables are used for modelling (e.g., soil type),
they should be distinguished from the continuous data by a prefix (e.g., "C_soiltype.bil"). Provide
the distinguishing prefix here so that MaxEnt can distinguish bewteen categorical and continuous
environmental layers.}

\item{alloutputs}{Should secondary outputs from MaxEnt be generated \code{TRUE/FALSE}? Including:

1: A raster showing the spatial distribution of clamping for each run.

2: A multidimensional environmental similarity surface (MESS) showing novel climates.

3: Files containing the parameters used to make the response curves.

4: Plots of the response curves for each parameter

The final set of arguments are optional and used for tuning the maxent model and cross-validation:}

\item{reptype}{Type of replication ("Crossvalidate", "Bootstrap", "Subsample"; see MAXENT manual).
Default is "Subsample".}

\item{test_percent}{(numeric): integer between 0 and 100: percentage of points "held back" for
crossvalidation, Test AUC validation, etc. Default is 20.}

\item{features}{(optional): a vector of the features for MaxEnt to model the species-
environment relationships with. Options are one or more of \code{"linear", "quadratic", "product",
"threshold", "hinge"}. Refer to the MaxEnt help page for more information about each feature class
If there are few occurrence points, hinge features are discouraged. Default is all feature classes.}

\item{testsamples}{(optional) If cross-validation with a new set of occurrence points is required,
this should be a list of full file paths corresponding to the validation occurrence points for each
species. This will take presidence over the random test percentage given in \code{test_percent}.
NOTE: if using null AUC validation, testsamples must be given!}

\item{regularization}{(numeric) regularization parameter (penalizes complex models). A higher
regularization means more weight given to simpler models. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Provides the trained model for each replicate and species (.lambdas file), a summary of
the outputs provided by the maxent.jar executable, a .csv file containing information on the
AUC values, threshold values, variable importance, etc., and (as requested) all of the outputs
given in the \code{alloutputs} description. A full summary of the output maxent.jar provides
can be found the MaxEnt manual.
}
\description{
Takes occurrence points and background points of many species and models
them using the MaxEnt algorithm, parallelizing the process across multiple
computer cores.
